Were going to build our own unit test library with a similar syntax to how other popular unit test libraries work. 
Given the following code, define the "expecting", "toBe", "equalTo", "lessThan" and "greaterThan" functions so that the code successfully executes with the shown outputs.

const addNumbers = (numbers) =>{
  return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
}

const result = addNumbers([1, 2, 3]);
const result2 = expecting(result).toBeEqualTo(6); 
const result3 = expecting(result).toBeGreaterThan(5); 
const result4 = expecting(result).toBeEqualTo(7);
