// Given a set of elements, generate the power set (all the subsets)

// input [1, 2, 3]
// output [[], [1, 2, 3], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]

// input => [1,2]
//output => [[],[1],[2],[1,2]]
//traversing through an array
// making a new arry for the subsets
//could I somehow traverse another arry to
//pick out the numbers and push them into a new arry?
//sorting or pushing? -> SPREAD OPERATOR
