// Question: You've built an inflight entertainment system
//with on-demand movie streaming.

// Users on longer flights like to start a second
//movie right when their first one ends, but they complain
//that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending.
//So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total
//runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

// Write a function that takes an integer flightLength
//(in minutes) and an array of integers movieLengths
//(in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating
//whether there are two numbers in movieLengths
//whose sum equals flightLength.

// When building your function:

// Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
// Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
// Optimize for runtime over memory

//totalFLightLength([30, 12, 60, 15], 90); //O(n^2)
//console.log(totalFLightLength2([30, 12, 60, 15], 90)); //O(n^2)
//make sure that this isnt the same movie?? - compare the lengths
