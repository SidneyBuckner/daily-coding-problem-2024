// Given an array of integers, create a binary search tree.
// Input could be an array like: [10, 4, 8, 11, 15, 30, 1, 3, 5]
//Output? - [10,]
// The output may vary slightly based on how you design your tree data structure,
//but generally speaking, you would return the root of the tree as 10, with all
// numbers smaller to the left and all numbers larger to the right.

// The output will be a data structure that represents a tree.
// That could mean you have a Node object with a value and a leftChild
// and rightChild that are each Nodes

// setting up class for binary tree value and left/right node
//class for the tree - setting the root
//does first index in array need to be specified as the root?
//Tree is empty? Do something...
//nodes in tree? Do something...
// If its BST. No Duplicates?...
