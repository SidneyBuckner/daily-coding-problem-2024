# Daily Deep Dive Into Puzzle / Leetcode Problems

Reviewing essentials on Javascript Data Structures and algorithms along with front end engineering interview concepts. The main focus of these exercises is to get more comfortable with interview environments and problems focusing on javascript fundamental concepts. Problems and Resources Provided by [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) and [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html)

## [Bounds / Rules to Follow:](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

1. One Coding Problem a day. Go in Order to make things easier by the Daily Coding Problem & Eloquent Javascript Books based on the subjects listed below.

2. Focus on one of the two options: Solving the problem in a coding environment during one session OR draw it out in Figma.  

3. Use 45 Minutes of time on drawing or solving the problem. 15 to talk it through to decompress. Record your findings and understanding of the problem.

4. If you get the answer right on the first try, great! You can move to the next problem the next day or refactor into another solution the next day.

5. If you do not solve the problem that day, put it down, decompress try again the next day, for three days.

6. Repeat cycle for 3 days, if the solution has not been found by the 3rd day, LOOK UP A SOLUTION. Keep track of the solutions you do not get for the week.

7. Review sessions for 1 week once a month. Go through the problems you have missed or not completed within three days and review them step by step through a drawing in figma with a solution in hand.

8. Keep moving with the progress you've made.
