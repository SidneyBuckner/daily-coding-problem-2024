### Results
I looked up the solutions for this and I DO NOT REMEMBER it being THAT EASY. I have to remember to stop thinking about my solution being wrong and trying things anyways.

My initial approach to remember that this was a stack was correct. But where I veered off was thinking I needed to create the comparison statement to apply strictly to the first index which is not the case.

I need to include the first index into the stack as it is. So validating only if its the valid parens in line with the problem itself. THEN push that index into the stack
From there I can either pop the index out if its not valid OR I can make a comparison with another if statement, asking to meet an and AND or condition.
