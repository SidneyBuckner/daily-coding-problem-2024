You are given a string the length of l and and integer of n. The string can be manipulated by taking one of the first n letters and moving it to the end of the string.
Write a program to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be created after an unlimited number of moves
Example: we are given the string "daily" and n = 1. The answer would be "ailyd"
