### Time to understand


### Things To Remember: 
- Keep using Sora to talk to as a guide!
- I will need to change my process around as I got for interviews I will be instead of doing a 4 day rule, shrink the timeline to 2 days. So after I don't solve the problem after 2 days, I look at a solution and in detail explain what I understand about it in my notes and then work it in figma. This will keep me going in my work to understand things quickly and get a broad sense to problems.
- Keep Figma up somewhere 
- If you need to record yourself while doing the problem so you can talk it out then do so!
- Keep talking to Cody if that helps!
