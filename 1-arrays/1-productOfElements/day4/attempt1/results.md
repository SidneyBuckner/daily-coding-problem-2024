### Results
Initially I knew that the easiest way to solve this problem is to use division. But what has been difficult sticking into my head is remembering that there are two ways to solve this particular problem and one of them does not use division. I confused the steps to use for the no division solution with the division solution. And I need to be more careful of this going forward. 
It throws me off balance as if I do not know how to code which is not the case.

I have 3 variables the start off with, one to display the new result, one to store the product everytime it is calculated,, and one to store the quotient everytime THAT is calculated.


### Time to solve
20 minutes to attempt the problem.

### Time to understand
2-3 hours to understand what the heck was going on and ChatGPT + the book just being kinda wack on this.
