### Results

getting familiar with my local environment again...
Definitely took the whole time to get back to setting my environment. Its feels embarrassing. 
I know that the index of the product array should be the results of multiplying all of the other indices in the first array.

This is an experiment and were taking it one day at a time...
I need to remember that for each number i need to multiply all the other numbers and then that product is pushed into a new array.
