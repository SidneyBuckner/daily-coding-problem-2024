### What Do I know about the problem?
After sitting with the previous time I attempted this problem I knew that after massing around with the nested for loops would be important to THIS strategy to solve the problem going forward. Since I am going through the index of the parent loop and all three indicies in the nested loop.

### Results
 What helped tip me off to the next steps is my logs to the console in my parent loop and the nested loop on how the loops in general go through their process. Once I have the the index of the parent loop set I can start compariing the other values in the nested loop and determine if they should be multiplied into the product variable.

Then after the full cycle ot the second for loop I push the new product value into the results array. Reset my product and start over again at the next index at the parent for loop level!

THINGS TO REMEMBER: 
- Keep using Sora to talk to as a guide
- Continue to have figma open for explaining your thought process as you go along
- Console.log EVERYTHING!!!

### How can I explain this to a 5yo?
