### What Do I know about the problem?
I know that initially since this is an array I need to traverse through it to do SOMETHING.
Now that I have My values up to the total product that they multiply up to. I need to find a way to push these values into the new array. 

What Im thinking I can do first is that when I get the new product in the first loop and can push the results into the new array. But that wont work since The total product jumps from 3 to 6 and stays at 6. And THe output of my Original test case involves an array with a value of 2 in it. 

This is where I can divide!

Next now Im putting a nest loop into the solution and now I want to divide the total product by the values of the original array and push them into the new array.


### Results
Nested Loop I have to remember will use the same index at I to then initialize the next set of steps of ALL the indices of j in the calculation fo the result Im wanting. 
For example, When my total product with the first loop was just 3, this activated my next loop in which the product 3 was divided by 3, 2 and 1 which is not the result I wanted.
So Instead I brought the nested loop to the global scope and used a variable for the division operation to hold the value after I ge the total product value of the indices in the sample array

THINGS TO REMEMBER: The actions of a nested loop will result in exacting ALL the operations on one of the parent loop's indices.
Talking to sora Tsum Tsum worked really well with using Figma to draw things out in conjunction. Use this combo more often.

### How can I explain this to a 5yo?
idk yet! 

First we have to realize that multiplying all the values of the array have a total value thats useful. Think of it like a line of students.

To get to this total value, we need to go through each person in the line and multiply them altogether to get the value we need and save that value for later. 

Now that we have everyone together, we can start evenly distributing ...

Idk yet... Might want to do this problem again to better understand what Im doing.  

### Time to solve
50 mins with initial division approach

### Time to understand
50mins after drawing out some examples in Figma
