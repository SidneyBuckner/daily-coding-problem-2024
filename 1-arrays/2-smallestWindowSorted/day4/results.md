### Results
NOT SOLVED - after 2 hours I sought a solution through ChatGPT and realized that I would need two separate loops to find the bounds in which the array values needed to be sorted. 

For my first few attempts at a solution I think I was on the right track to getting the start bounds index where I track if the previous index is greater or smaller than the current index Im checking against. but whats had me tripped up is determining then what the conditions are for the end bounds. Specifically, finding the end bounds within one for loop. One thing ill also need to determine going forward is asking myself if any solutions or attempt at executing code will need more than one loop if the conditional statements don't support the range in which Im doing calculations.

The solution dictates that we loop through the entire array once to determine is the current index value is smaller than the biggest number in the array, and set that index the value it's as as a bound. Similar to the first loop, the second loop will iterate backwards through the array and determine the bound index if the current value is greater than the minimum or smallest value in the array and make that index a bounds.

I still don't completely understand this. So I am going through a mind mapping exercise where I have the solution and translate it from code to pictures line by line and make an attempt code wise at this problem again tomorrow and until I don't need a solution.

### Things To Remember:
- Ask yourself if I might need more than one loop? Try it out to see what you find.
- Keep using Sora to talk to as a guide
- Continue to have Figma open for explaining your thought process as you go along
- Console.log EVERYTHING!!!

### How can I explain this to a 5yo?
idk yet!
