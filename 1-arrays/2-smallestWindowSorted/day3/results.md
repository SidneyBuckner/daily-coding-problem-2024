### Results
NOT SOLVED - Went to figma to do more pseudo code practice for this process and felt that was best.
I am starting to realize it was to my advantage to make the first conditional as an or statement so that I can determine whether or not the first index I encounter should be the startBound value and move the value when I have more information as Im going through the loop

### Things To Remember: 
- Keep using Sora to talk to as a guide
- Continue to have figma open for explaining your thought process as you go along
- Console.log EVERYTHING!!!
- [Mind mapping loops vertically helps my mind process better what im doing and fits better on the page! ](/Users/sidneybuckner/Code/daily-coding-problem-2024/1-arrays/2-smallestWindowSorted/day2/FigmaScreenshot.png)

### How can I explain this to a 5yo?
