Needed to remember the part where I keep track of the min number and max number so far I've seen in the array samples Im working with.

Started off first by determining which arrays would be for figuring out the start or end bound, I chose to start with the End bound with a loop going forward through an array. I make a comparison of the current value, to the next value in the array and determined if the current value is less than the next value in the array THEN, we make the current value the end bound.

Initially that worked, but what I noticed is that since I was getting the end index as the endbound that needs to change, I worked with Cody to understand that I need to have a space in which I can keep track of what max numbers and min number values Ive see so far iterating forwards and backwards through the array. 


### Things To Remember:
- Ask yourself if I might need more than one loop? Try it out to see what you find.
- Keep using Sora to talk to as a guide
- Continue to have Figma open for explaining your thought process as you go along
- Console.log EVERYTHING!!!
- [Mind mapping loops vertically helps my mind process better what im doing and fits better on the page! ](/Users/sidneybuckner/Code/daily-coding-problem-2024/1-arrays/2-smallestWindowSorted/day2/FigmaScreenshot.png)

### How can I explain this to a 5yo?
